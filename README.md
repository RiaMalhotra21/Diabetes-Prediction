# Diabetes-Prediction
In this project, I use an SVM classifier, a robust machine learning algorithm, to predict diabetes likelihood based on medical attributes. The model classifies individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic using features like glucose levels, blood pressure, BMI, and age. The goal is to create an accurate predictive model for early diagnosis.
